# Silent Classroom 🎓

## Problem
In many classrooms, students hesitate to ask questions or give honest feedback due to fear, shyness, or time constraints. As a result, teachers often lack real insights into students’ understanding, leading to learning gaps.

## Solution
Silent Classroom solves this by enabling **anonymous, secure, and structured student feedback** after every class. Students can share doubts, rate sessions, and express understanding freely, while teachers receive meaningful insights to improve teaching effectiveness.

## How It Works
- Students log in and submit anonymous feedback
- Feedback is stored securely using Firebase
- Teachers view class-wise insights via a dashboard
